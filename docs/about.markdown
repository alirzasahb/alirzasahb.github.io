> Hi, I'm Alireza — welcome!
I'm a software engineer with a deep appreciation for the open-source community. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, but when I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me immersed in a good book or exploring the world of anime.

This blog is a space where I share both technical insights and personal reflections. I’m here to contribute what I’ve learned, and just as importantly, to grow through the ideas and experiences of others. Thanks for stopping by!
